# Python Console Banking System üí∞

Welcome to the **Python Console Banking System**, a simple and powerful application that simulates the core functionalities of a bank right in your terminal. This project is a great showcase of fundamental programming concepts, including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **robust error management**.

Whether you're a student, a developer, or just curious about how backend systems work, this project provides a clear, practical example of how to build a reliable data management application from the ground up.

## üìÇ Under the Hood

The project is structured to be easy to understand and extend:

* `banking_system.py`: This is the heart of the application, containing all the logic. It's where you'll find the `Account` class (which defines what an account is) and the `Bank` class (which manages all the accounts and their operations).
* `accounts.json`: This file is automatically created the first time you run the script. It serves as your database, storing all account information in a clean, readable JSON format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**: The foundation of the entire system.
* **JSON**: Used for data serialization, allowing us to store and retrieve data easily.
